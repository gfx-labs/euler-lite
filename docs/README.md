### 🪙 [Token List](./token-list.md)

- Four-source token list (Euler SDK, DefiLlama, Uniswap, Merkl reward tokens)
- Parallel fetch via `Promise.allSettled` with per-source stale fallback
- Pre-populated at server startup by `warm-cache.ts`
- CSP considerations for logo URLs

### 🌍 [Geo-Blocking](./geo-blocking.md)

- Country detection and sanctioned country lists
- Product-level, per-vault, earn-vault, and asset-level blocking rules
- Asset-level pattern matching (exact `symbols`/`names` + `symbolRegex`/`nameRegex`) and cross-chain `all/assets.json`
- Country group aliases (EU, EEA, EFTA)
- UI enforcement across browse, detail, action, and modal pages, plus the arbitrary-asset swap selector

### 🌐 [Public API](./public-api.md)

- Publicly reachable endpoints under `/api/public/` (CORS `*`)
- `GET /api/public/is-known` — verified-vault lookup by address (or list mode)
- `GET /api/public/metadata` — uniform vault display metadata (name / description / governing entity / asset) across EVK, Securitize, and Earn
- Request/response shape, caching, rate limits, and examples

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Euler Lite** is a lightweight multi-chain DeFi application that provides lending and borrowing services through the Euler Finance protocol. It supports multiple EVM chains and connects via standard EVM wallets. The application allows users to:

- **Lend Assets**: Deposit crypto assets to earn yield
- **Borrow Assets**: Use collateral to borrow other assets
- **Swap Collateral & Debt**: Swap between collateral or debt assets via integrated DEX routing
- **Swap-and-Supply/Borrow**: Deposit or borrow with automatic cross-asset swaps
- **Repay from Savings**: Repay debt using savings positions (same or cross-asset)
- **Explore Markets**: Discover and compare markets grouped by curator/product
- **Manage Portfolio**: Track positions, rewards, and performance
- **Access Rewards**: Participate in Merkl, Incentra, and Fuul reward programs

## 🏛️ Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: Nuxt.js 3, Vue 3, TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: Multiple EVM chains
- **DeFi Protocol**: Euler Finance
- **Wallet Integration**: Wagmi / Reown (EVM wallets)
- **Styling**: SCSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: Vue Composition API with composables
- **Linting**: ESLint (flat config) with pre-commit hooks (simple-git-hooks + lint-staged)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit/integration)
