# Public API

Endpoints under `/api/public/` are intentionally reachable from any origin (no CORS allowlist) and are intended to be consumed by external integrators.

The `/api/public/` path prefix is the contract: any handler placed below it in `server/api/public/` automatically receives `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` via `server/middleware/cors.ts`. Do not put internal endpoints under this prefix.

All public endpoints are rate-limited per client IP and return JSON.

## `GET /api/public/is-known`

Answers whether a given vault address is considered verified by this app — the same verdict the client UI applies before rendering a vault as a known market.

A vault is **verified** through one of two paths:

- **Escrow path**: the address appears in the on-chain set returned by `escrowedCollateralPerspective.verifiedArray()` for the chain. Escrow vaults are trusted unconditionally; no product, entity, or governor check applies.
- **Label + authority path**:
  - EVK / Securitize vaults must appear under a product's `vaults[]` or `deprecatedVaults[]` in `products.json`.
  - The product must declare at least one `entity` key.
  - The vault's `governorAdmin` must be in the `addresses` map of one of the product's declared entities. If the vault's oracle router has a non-zero governor, that governor must also match.
  - A product whose `entity` field is empty or omitted is treated as having no on-chain authority to claim the vault — every vault under such a product is unverified, regardless of its `governorAdmin`.

Earn vaults listed only in `earn-vaults.json` are trusted on the strength of the Earn label entry. If an Earn vault also appears under a product, the current verifier applies an owner/entity match against that product; current labels do not use that shape.

For EVK / Securitize vaults, the same governor check applies to active and deprecated vaults — deprecation does not change the verification rule. The `notExplorable` flag does **not** change verification either: vaults hidden from Explore are still verified.

### Scope of `is-known`

`is-known` reflects **label / governance consistency only** — that an EVK / Securitize vault's on-chain governor still matches the entity declared by its product label, that an Earn vault is trusted by its Earn label entry, or that the vault is in the on-chain escrow perspective. It does **not** assert:

- smart-contract configuration safety (LTVs, oracle setup, IRM, hooks)
- absence of risk signals (oracle staleness, asset health, liquidity, market conditions)
- visibility decisions (whether the vault is shown on lend / borrow / explore pages)

This endpoint deliberately does not encode configuration-safety or risk-context signals. Integrators that need those signals should consume dedicated risk or market-data endpoints instead of inferring them from `is-known`.

See [vault-labels-and-verification.md](./vault-labels-and-verification.md) for how the label sources themselves are structured.

### Request

| Param       | Type     | Required | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chainId`   | integer  | yes      | EVM chain ID (e.g. `1` for mainnet).                                        |
| `addresses` | string   | no       | Comma-separated list of vault addresses. Max 100. Lowercase or valid EIP-55 checksum accepted; mixed-case inputs must have a correct checksum. Omit to return the full known set ("list mode"). |

### Response

Status `200`, JSON object keyed by EIP-55 checksum addresses.

**Lookup mode** (`addresses` provided) — one entry per input address mapped to `true` / `false`:

```json
{
  "0xAbC…": true,
  "0xDeF…": false
}
```

**List mode** (`addresses` omitted) — every known address on the chain mapped to `true`:

```json
{
  "0xAbC…": true,
  "0xDeF…": true
}
```

Addresses are validated via viem's `isAddress` (strict EIP-55 checks) and normalized to checksum form before comparison. All-lowercase hex inputs are accepted; mixed-case inputs must carry a valid EIP-55 checksum or the request is rejected with `400`. All-uppercase inputs are rejected. Keys in the response always use the checksum form.

### Errors

| Status | Cause                                                                    |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `400`  | Missing/invalid `chainId`, `chainId` not supported by this deployment, >100 addresses, or a malformed address. |
| `429`  | Rate limit exceeded for this client IP.                                  |
| `502`  | All upstream sources (labels endpoint, chains config, RPC proxy) failed and no stale cache is available. |

### Caching and propagation

- **Response header**: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=30, stale-while-revalidate=30`. CDNs and browsers can cache for 30 s and serve stale for another 30 s while revalidating.
- **Server-side cache**: per-chain in-memory verified set with a 5-minute TTL. A warm-cache process rebuilds every cache entry every 5 minutes on its own schedule (force-refresh, ignores fresh entries), so the cache is always continuously fresh in steady state.
- **In-flight dedup**: concurrent cold requests for the same chain collapse onto a single upstream pass.
- **Propagation**: on-chain governor changes and `products.json` / `entities.json` edits typically propagate within **~5 minutes**. The labels / vault snapshot and the verified-set cache are warmed on the same 5-minute cycle, so a label edit picked up by the labels cache flows into the next bridge rebuild within the same cycle.
- **Stale fallback**: during prolonged upstream outages (labels endpoint, vault snapshot, or RPC failing), the bridge serves the last-known-good verified set for up to 10 minutes past TTL before returning a hard error.

### Rate limit

100 requests per minute per client IP.

### CORS

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Preflight (`OPTIONS`) responds with `204` and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type`.

### Examples

Single address:

```bash
curl 'https://<host>/api/public/is-known?chainId=1&addresses=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890'
```

```json
{ "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890": false }
```

Batch lookup:

```bash
curl 'https://<host>/api/public/is-known?chainId=1&addresses=0xAAA…,0xBBB…,0xCCC…'
```

```json
{
  "0xAAA…": true,
  "0xBBB…": false,
  "0xCCC…": true
}
```

From the browser (verifying CORS):

```js
const res = await fetch(
  'https://<host>/api/public/is-known?chainId=1&addresses=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890'
)
const map = await res.json()
```

## `GET /api/public/metadata`

Returns display metadata for one or many vaults on a chain, in a uniform shape across vault flavours (EVK, Securitize, Earn). Escrow vaults are rendered as a special-case EVK with the constant name `"Escrowed collateral"`.

This endpoint answers "what is this vault?" — the trust verdict (`is-known`) is intentionally not part of the response. Callers compose the two endpoints when they need both.

### Request

| Param       | Type     | Required | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chainId`   | integer  | yes      | EVM chain ID (e.g. `1` for mainnet).                                        |
| `addresses` | string   | no       | Comma-separated list of vault addresses. Max 100. Same casing rules as `/is-known`. Omit to return every known vault on the chain ("list mode"). |
| `productId` | string   | no       | Product slug from `products.json` (e.g. `euler-prime`). When set, only entries whose `productId` equals this value are returned. Combines with `addresses`: an address that resolves but belongs to a different product returns `null`. `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`, max 100 chars. |

### Response

Status `200`, JSON object keyed by EIP-55 checksum addresses.

**Lookup mode** (`addresses` provided): one entry per input address. Unknown addresses (not in any labels file and not in the on-chain escrow perspective) resolve to `null`.

**List mode** (`addresses` omitted): every known vault on the chain. No `null` values.

Each `VaultMetadata` entry has the shape:

```ts
interface VaultMetadata {
  chainId: number
  address: string                            // checksummed
  type: 'evk' | 'securitize' | 'earn'        // escrow is a special-case EVK; see name override
  name: string                               // never null — falls back to on-chain ERC-20 name only when labels carry no name
  description: string | null
  portfolioNotice: string | null
  deprecationReason: string | null
  deprecated: boolean                        // true if listed under any product's deprecatedVaults or earn entry has deprecated: true
  governanceLimited: boolean                 // true when the owning product has the "governance limited" tag. False for vaults without a product.
  productId: string | null                   // product slug from products.json that owns this vault; null for escrow and for vaults with no product entry
  asset: {
    address: string                          // checksummed
    symbol: string
    name: string
    decimals: number
    url: string | null                       // same logoURI /api/internal/token-list serves; null when no source carries it
  } | null
  entities: Array<{
    name: string
    logo: string                             // full URL composed from the labels CDN config
    description: string | null
    url: string | null                       // entity website; only set when http(s) URL
  }>                                         // empty array when no entity matches (escrow, unverified, or no product); usually 0 or 1 entry, but can be N when a product declares multiple entities that all match the on-chain governor
}
```

### Resolution rules

Label-derived display fields (`name`, `description`, `portfolioNotice`, `deprecationReason`, `productId`) are sourced from labels regardless of verification state — they are authoritative content set by the team that listed the vault. For product-owned EVK / Securitize vaults, per-vault `vaultOverrides` take precedence over product-level values. Earn vault metadata comes from the `earn-vaults.json` entry, with product fallback fields only if an Earn address is also present in `products.json`. The on-chain ERC-20 `name` is only a fallback when no label name is defined.

`entities` identifies every declared product entity whose `addresses` contain the vault's `governorAdmin` (or `owner` for an Earn vault that also appears under a product). A product can declare multiple entity keys, and more than one of those can match — the array preserves the declared-key order. Resolution depends on the vault's verification state:

- **Verified non-escrow vault** (governor match against at least one declared entity): `entities` contains every matching entity from `entities.json`, with `logo` composed as a full URL. Usually 1 entry, but can be N.
- **Unverified vault** (in labels but governor mismatch, or in a product that declares no entity): `entities` is `[]`. Other label fields (`name`, `description`, `portfolioNotice`, `deprecationReason`, `productId`, `deprecated`) are still populated. `asset` and `type` are also populated.
- **Earn vault without a product entry** (`earn-vaults.json` only): `entities` is `[]`.
- **Escrow vault** (`escrowedCollateralPerspective.verifiedArray()`): `name` is the constant `"Escrowed collateral"`; all label-derived fields and `productId` are `null`; `entities` is `[]`; `deprecated: false`; `asset` comes from the snapshot when the address is in the referenced subset, otherwise `null`.

The `deprecated` boolean distinguishes deprecated-but-otherwise-fine vaults from genuinely unverified ones. For EVK / Securitize vaults, the same governor check applies to deprecated and active vaults — deprecation only sets the `deprecated` flag and (typically) populates `deprecationReason`.

Earn vaults resolve with `description` / `portfolioNotice` / `deprecationReason` from the earn entry. Current labels do not place Earn vaults in `products.json`, so they resolve with `productId: null` and `entities: []`.

#### `entities` is not equivalent to `is-known`

`entities` answers "who manages this vault"; it is independent of `is-known`. An empty `entities` array does **not** mean the vault is unknown — escrow vaults and Earn vaults without a product entry return `entities: []` while still being `is-known: true`.

Use `/api/public/is-known` for the verification verdict. Use the non-`null` / `null` distinction on `/api/public/metadata` for metadata presence. A labeled EVK / Securitize vault with a governor mismatch can return `is-known: false` while still returning non-`null` metadata.

### Errors

| `502`  | Required upstream sources (`products.json`, `entities.json`, vault snapshot) failed and no stale cache is available. |

### Caching and propagation

Same shape as [`/is-known` caching](#caching-and-propagation):

- **Response header**: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=30, stale-while-revalidate=30`.
- **Server-side cache**: per-chain in-memory metadata map, 5-minute TTL.
- **Warm cycle**: the warm-cache plugin force-rebuilds the metadata map every 5 minutes on its own schedule, so a fresh entry is always available.
- **In-flight dedup**: concurrent cold requests for the same chain collapse onto a single upstream pass.
- **Propagation**: on-chain changes and label edits propagate within **~5 minutes**.
- **Stale fallback**: serves last-known-good data for up to 10 minutes past TTL during prolonged upstream outages.

### Rate limit

100 requests per minute per client IP. Independent of the `/is-known` limit.

### CORS

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Same preflight behaviour as the rest of `/api/public/`.

## Implementation notes

- Handlers: `server/api/public/is-known.get.ts`, `server/api/public/metadata.get.ts`
- Verified-set builder + cache: `server/utils/verified-vaults.ts`
- Metadata builder + cache: `server/utils/vault-metadata.ts`
- Shared verification rule (also used by the client UI): `utils/vault/governor-verification.ts`
- CORS bypass for the `/api/public/` prefix lives in `server/middleware/cors.ts`.
- Escrow vaults are read via an `eth_call` to `escrowedCollateralPerspective.verifiedArray()`. The perspective address is looked up from `EulerChains.json` (served by `/api/internal/euler-chains`), and the RPC endpoint is taken from `RPC_URL_<chainId>`. Products and earn-vault label files are fetched via internal self-calls to `/api/internal/labels/<file>` to reuse the labels endpoint's own cache and validation. Entity logo URLs are composed from `NUXT_PUBLIC_CONFIG_LABELS_BASE_URL` (or the `REPO`/`REPO_BRANCH` fallback) so they match the URL the app itself renders.
