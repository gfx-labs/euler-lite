 * Request headers for the Merkl upstream fetch made by `/api/internal/proxy/merkl`.
 *
 * Merkl serves anonymous requests at 10 req/sec, but every user's Merkl read
 * is funnelled through this one server-side proxy origin, so the anonymous
 * quota is shared across all traffic and is the binding limit under load. When
 * `MERKL_API_KEY` is configured we send it as `X-API-Key` for a higher quota;
 * the key stays server-side and is never exposed to the browser. The shape
 * mirrors `buildV3ProxyRequestHeaders` in `v3-proxy.ts`.
